It’s so beautiful here. From one of the peaks in Jizzakh, I look out over Uzbekistan's rural mountains, alongside my friends from college, a few donkeys, a portable speaker blasting Future, and some of the locals. 

This last year, I’ve flown over eighty thousand miles to explore other states, countries, and continents. I confess to you now that throughout most of these trips, I didn’t really know what it was all for.

They say traveling is important, and that my hometown Saratoga is dreary to stay in. I even begin echoing that to others, preaching the importance of seeing the world while not really being able to articulate any profound lessons. I guess I’m just sort of skeptical of it all.

But when I look out now, seeing the clouds cast shadows over endless green-gray terrain and hearing my friends’ voices drowned out by the wind, I just feel so small. I wonder if this is it—if this is the point of traveling.

I think hard to find a comparable memory or place but can’t come up with anything close. And as I’m hit with the realization that this is likely the last time I’ll ever stand on this mountain, I wonder when I could ever experience something like this again.

I turn to Justin and ask, “You think we’d be able to experience this in VR in the future?”

“No—it’s just not the same.” He thinks for a bit, and continues, “You won’t be able to feel the wind against your face. You won’t be able to feel the grass. You can’t see the kid push the donkey with the stick”—he gestures to Skrullo, our local tour guide—“You can’t laugh at the kid and he can’t laugh back at you.”

At the end of the trip, when we reflect back on the grand mosques or amazing lamb or the laughs with the boys, I tell him, “These are the moments to live for.”

Is that it? These grand memories, the once-in-a-lifetime moments? Maybe to live is to experience as many of these as you can:

- In Shenzhen: a “hall-of-fame-worthy” date with my girlfriend, sitting right by the water and the fountain show, googling what abalone is and taking cute film photos. A small honey-yellow table lamp lights up her face and I find it all very pretty.
- In Rome: Biking through the city on our way towards the Colosseum, next to lifelong friends that I had just met a week ago. We felt the cobblestone under our wheels and the wind in our face.
- In Costa Rica: after counting up turtle eggs as the mom laid them, my best friends from high school sat down on the beach with me in the night, grabbing handfuls of wet sand as we talked. It’s dark but we can see our shadows in the moonlight. Barely hearing the chatter of other volunteers off in the distance, it was just us three, our moon shadows, and the waves crashing down in front of us.
